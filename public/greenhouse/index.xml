      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My dad has a large fish pond and would like to use the solar system to run the pumps, which require 150W of power. Can the solar system run the pumps 24/7?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;battery-capacity-overview&#34;&gt;Battery Capacity Overview&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The battery system has a capacity of 170Ah at 24V, equating to 4kWh of total stored energy. In practice, the battery state of charge (SoC) should not drop below 20% to maintain battery health, resulting in 3.26kWh of usable energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-i-heat-the-greenhouse&#34;&gt;Can I heat the greenhouse?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first idea was to see if it is possible to maintain a 5 degree C temperature gradient between the inside and outside of the greenhouse. I wondered how much power I would need to do this. Below is a calculation to do just that but getting the constants right is pretty tricky and ambiguous at best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The calculation is based upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/singlepane_window_heat_loss_13863.htm&#34;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and these websites give a good idea of what the constants for the windows might be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-the-build-commence&#34;&gt;Let The Build Commence&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The date is the 5th of February 2022 and It&amp;rsquo;s cold. It&amp;rsquo;s really cold. Luckily for me my friend Will offered to help with the build. We had 48 hours to do so before getting back to work in Oxford on the Monday! So please excuse the messy wiring, we really didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time or daylight!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-greenhouse&#34;&gt;The Greenhouse!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The greenhouse is actually a conservatory tacked onto the side of the &amp;ldquo;old house&amp;rdquo; as we call it which is a 4x4m building that my grandparents lived in for many years before building their house across the road. This 4x4m building contained a kitchen, toilet, fireplace, and a bed. A reminder of how privileged I am to be living in the current age. Fortunately for me, this building is now free range for projects and the fact that this project revolves around plants, well, I think my grandfather would approve. To the right is one of my grandfathers original greenhouses where he used to  light methylated spirit burners in the winter to keep his plants warm. I&amp;rsquo;m doing the same, except using renewable resources but costing at least 100 times more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013 I&amp;rsquo;d have just completed my 3rd year at university and was pretty interested in grow cells for vertical farming and wanted to build an automated greenhouse for myself. After my degree I even had a PHD setup on this topic! Alas i decided to venture into the big bad world. Anyway, I was hyped to built my own automated greenhouse! I dug a trench from the house to the greenhouse and laid armoured cable. Installed a Raspberry pi and used powerline networking to connect to the internet. I got as far as installing a watering system using some solenoid valves that connected to the mains water. Things were looking pretty good. Finally, I had also installed around 50 temperature sensors with an aim of creating a homogenous temperature distribution within the greenhouse with heaters and fans. I never got that far but I did collect a lot of useless data&amp;hellip; Well life happened since then and its now 2022 and I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about that damn greenhouse again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
