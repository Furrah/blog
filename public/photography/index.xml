      <description>For my 30th birthday my friends bought me a day out with the foraging fanatic Fergus Drennan and what a day it was! It ran from 08:30 until 22:00 and was rammed full of quirky tastings, information overloads, and fruitful foraging. The Park The Park  -- After meeting at the train station we all piled into three cars and headed down to the park. Fergus sat us down in a circle beside a pond full of mace reed and started removing numerous berries on their branches from his backpack.</description>

      <description>function writeImage ( path ) { var text = &#34; &#34; document.write(text) }  Oskar&amp;rsquo;s final interview! Did he get it? at the point of writing this, we still don&amp;rsquo;t know! What we did know is that Oskar had decided he was taking Jamie and I to Zurich. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure how it all came about but three boys in a hole went on tour!
We arrived in Zurich (Joe and Jamie) and found Oskar after some major confusion over how big Zurich train station was.</description>

      <description>function writeImage ( path ) { var text = &#34; &#34; document.write(text) }  June 2020. We all went on a little summer trip to Avoriaz. Or somewhere close? Heres a picture of the &amp;lsquo;Super best friends&amp;rsquo; as Branko would say and obviously theres always one person to have their eyes closed and in this instance, it was Jamie. Maybe oskar too with his blind man glasses on.

      <title>Morocco - The Atlas Mountains</title>

      <description>In August 2018 my friends and I visited the Atlas mountains of Morocco and walked up Mount Toubkal. Despite my camera having a horrendous light leak I managed to get a few photos of that walk.
We had envisioned a hike though the Atlas mountains off the typical tourist route, following the Berber trails. It became apparent after the first day of ascent that we weren&amp;rsquo;t equipped for this route. I remember feeling the exposure of the desert mountains, not being able to hide from the sun and slipping down constantly.</description>

      <description>This photo was taken on a walk around Bowland forest whilst I was studying at the University of Lancaster. It must be dated around 2016 and was shot on a Rolleiflex camera with Rollei IR400 Film. Ribblehead viaduct! This was taken on a separate trip. My friend Cristina convinced me and my friend Zane that this was infact the viaduct from Harry Potter that the Hogwarts Express crossed! It is not.</description>
