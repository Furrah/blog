      <description>XOR gates can be used to form inverters or buffers when a single input is tied to Vdd or Ground. In the figure below, U1 is setup as an inverter, and U2 is setup as a buffer.
The SN74LVC2G86 (Datasheet) is a dual package XOR that can operate at voltages up to 5.5V and deliver up to 50mA of continuous current. Other notable features include a propagation delay between 1.4 and 4.</description>
