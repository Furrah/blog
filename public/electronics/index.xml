      <description>Introduction In 2013 I discovered the DS18B20 digital thermometer IC made by Maxim Integrated. It&amp;rsquo;s a great little IC that has provides a 12 bit temperature measurement and interfaces over the 1-Wire bus allowing multiple sensors to be daisy chained! Back then I used veraboard and some terrible soldering to create the strings of sensors used in my greenhouse. Well its now 2022 and I&amp;rsquo;m back to thinking about greenhouses.</description>

      <title>Rules and Permissions for USB Blaster Setup in Linux Virtual Machine</title>
      <link>https://mybrainhertz.co.uk/usb-blaster-linux-quartus2-virtual-machine/</link>

      <description>SOURCE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18704913/unable-to-lock-chain-insufficient-port-permissions
If when jtagconfig is ran
1) USB-Blaster varient [2-1] unable to lock chain(Insufficient port permissions) is returned and Quartus cant program your FPGA. The following steps should fix this problem. An amazing resource on setting up Quartus and other Altera related design software is Altera Design Software 
Before a USB Blaster can be used its jtag rules and permissions must be configured.
First kill jtagd.
sudo killall -9 jtagd If jtagconfig is ran whilst jtagd is already running then jtagconfig will have no effect.</description>

      <description>Introduction The AD5627RBRMZ (Datasheet) is part of a series of 12/14/16 bit nano DACs with an I2C interface. The DAC we are interested in is the 12 bit AD5627RBRMZ which has a 5ppm/ËšC internal reference and can operate upto 5V.
Design The DAC requires a high I2C level to be 0.8 * Vcc, which is 4V if we are interested in using the full capability of the DAC. In this design the I2C is operating on a 3.</description>

      <description>The ADA4096 operational amplifier comes in a dual and quad package. Its inputs are protected by overvoltage protection diodes making it a perfect candidate for monitoring voltages, especially when power to the IC could be lost.
ADA4096 Datasheet
The LTC2990 is a Quad I2C voltage, current, and temperature monitor. When used in conjunction with the ADA4096 it makes a simple monitoring interface through I2C.
LTC2990 Datasheet
The LTC2990 supply voltages are between 3.</description>

      <title>XOR Logic used as a Buffer or Inverter</title>

      <description>XOR gates can be used to form inverters or buffers when a single input is tied to Vdd or Ground. In the figure below, U1 is setup as an inverter, and U2 is setup as a buffer.
The SN74LVC2G86 (Datasheet) is a dual package XOR that can operate at voltages up to 5.5V and deliver up to 50mA of continuous current. Other notable features include a propagation delay between 1.4 and 4.</description>

      <title>Precision Op Amp Gain Adjustment with DACs</title>
      <link>https://mybrainhertz.co.uk/op-amp-gain-adjustment-dac/</link>

      <description>Basic non-inverting operational amplifier design involves a feedback resistor and a gain resistor. These are shown in the figure below as R2 as the feedback resistor and R1 as the gain resistor. The formula for calculating the gain is;
\begin{align} Gain = \frac{R_2}{R_1} + 1 \end{align}
It would be nice to adjust the gain of this amplifier. This can be done achieved easily with a potentiometer in place of R1 or R2.</description>

      <description>Reference material: Texas Instruments - Op Amp Technical Overview
When developing precision DC systems BJT transistors are the way to go. Be careful when selecting an op amp based on its datasheet noise characteristics. At DC we are interested in the 1/f noise, which as the name suggests increases as we approach DC. an example is shown below comparing the JFET input OPA827 and the BJT input OPA227.
