In the morning I take a look around the temples vegetable garden and we continue. It’s still raining but only a drizzle. We’re gonna be ok. We’re trying to figure out where we might end up that night to sleep so we ask some passers by who are coming down how far they think the summit is. Anywhere from 2-4 hours we hear. Well we arrive at 3pm after leaving at 8am so it was around 7 hours for us… 

The summit is beautiful. Both will and I are overcome with emotion, joy, relief, exhaustion, the realisation we had to go back down. We both shed a tear or 10.
At the base we both light a candle in memory of our loved ones and then proceed climb the final steps to the golden statue. There are 1000s of tourists here as you can get a cable car up instead of climbing the infinite stairs. We spend an hour looking at the temples and just appreciating where we are. A German woman starts talking to us with a mouth full of food. She notices that we’re British and apologises for talking to hs with her mouth full as it’s rude in our country. It’s rude in everyone’s country. Stop talking to us. They were on an action packed tour of China spending very little time jn each place. For example they got a bus to the temple, spent an hour there and then were getting a bus down and onto the next place. The magic of this place was definitely I felt in the journey itself.

We begin our decent down and battle our way past the tourists and the monkeys stealing everyone’s open food. One woman almost lost her tote bag as a monkey tried to free it from her. The path becomes empty again and peace is restored. We make our way to the elephant pool temple and sleep for the night. The accommodation there is really nice! They even have toilets and showers! The shower at chu temple had blood up the wall and many big insects staring you down… 

We wake up in the morning and will is desperate for the toilet. He leaves the room and immediately comes back and locks the door. There’s a monkey guarding the moon gate to the main path to the toilet. It’s baring its teeth and snarling at us. I pick up my bamboo walking stick and we go out together and investigate. Don’t worry will I’ve got this as I start banging my stick on the floor. This really riles the monkey and it starts approaching us. We both run back and I’ve made matters worse. We repeat this several times before the monkey finds something more interesting. Will legs it to the toilet and I go down to the dining room for breakfast. Tofu skins, a potato curry dish and some pickled greens. 

We spend the rest of the day hiking down to the bottom taking the gorge route down and it is beautiful. The water gleams glacial blue as butterflies dance around. Will finds a couple of 100 plants we have seen before. We walk through an avenue of hankerchief trees and will is just blown away. He must have said “I must come back in spring” at least 1000 times on the mountain. It was incredible beautiful in its pre autumnal state but the mind does wonder what the mountain looks like in full bloom! 

The story continues, down down down we go. Finally as we are arriving at the bus station I finally sea a green snake! Hallelujah!

Approximately 10 pence later we are back in emeishan town bus station and the great pilgrimage is complete. 1 Buddhist mountain down, 3 to go.
