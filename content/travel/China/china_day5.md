In the morning we explore the temples garden where they are growing a large variety of vegetables. Amongst the many cabbages are also aubergines, chillis, squash, carrots, radish, leafy greens, tomatoes, and more! Most of what the temples eat is usually grown on site we've been told. This isn't exclusive to the temples though, we see vegetables being grown in every possible space that can sustain a plant. Cabbages grown on roadside verges can be seen absolutely everywhere in Sichuan as well as maize and other crops which probably stems from Chinas pursuit of self sufficiency and is deeply engrained in their society. 

Chinas connection with it's food feels very real and is something I wish to see more in the UK where people have lost touch with the origin of their food and have grown accustomed to supermarkets where a visceral link to the earth has been severed. Food on tap has become the norm and the beauty of the food market is seen as an encumbrance to productivity rather than a celebration of seasonality, community, and the pleasure of knowing where your food came from.

We leave the temple in the drizzle which follows us for for sometime before clearing up. We are blessed with some incredible views of the mountains as we climb and we are able to see the city of Emei below through the clouds.

An hour or so later we arrive at the temple we had aimed to get to the night before. It sits on top of a peak  above the cloud line with a clear view of the mountains in the distance. It's a stunning view but I think we might have had quite the cold night sleep if we had stayed here!

Later we encountered two prostrating Buddhists - taking three steps forward and then prostrating which is the act of bowing all the way to the floor with the head and hands touching the ground. A ritual honouring the Buddha but also an inward journey of surrender and purification. This is most often practised by Tibetan Buddhists. Their hands looked sore and cold, and their bodies exhausted as they took small breaks between each sequence. I stand in awe imaging myself doing this. I think I would break almost immediately.

I spent a good amount of time referencing Jurassic park, specifically the third film with the giant aviaries. I don't think Will has ever seen the films but they're all great. In fact, I would say they get greater as they go on. They are now on the seventh film and it is so terrible it might be the best one yet. Anyway, the route sometimes has areas to protect you from rock fall which look like cages. Most of the time it does not have these areas and you really wish it did.

We still have no idea how far away the summit it and we start to ask those who are coming back down how long they think we are from the summit. Some tell us two hours, others four, one couple said around an hour and a half away. We arrived at 3pm, so it took us about seven hours. and we weren't even going slow!

Finally, we emerge from the forest and arrive at the base of the summit. We still have an hour or so ahead of us and

The summit is beautiful. Both will and I are overcome with emotion, joy, relief, exhaustion, the realisation we had to go back down. We both shed a tear or 10.
At the base we both light a candle in memory of our loved ones and then proceed climb the final steps to the golden statue. There are 1000s of tourists here as you can get a cable car up instead of climbing the infinite stairs. We spend an hour looking at the temples and just appreciating where we are. A German woman starts talking to us with a mouth full of food. She notices that we’re British and apologises for talking to hs with her mouth full as it’s rude in our country. It’s rude in everyone’s country. Stop talking to us. They were on an action packed tour of China spending very little time jn each place. For example they got a bus to the temple, spent an hour there and then were getting a bus down and onto the next place. The magic of this place was definitely I felt in the journey itself.

We begin our decent down and battle our way past the tourists and the monkeys stealing everyone’s open food. One woman almost lost her tote bag as a monkey tried to free it from her. The path becomes empty again and peace is restored. We make our way to the elephant pool temple and sleep for the night. The accommodation there is really nice! They even have toilets and showers! The shower at chu temple had blood up the wall and many big insects staring you down… 

We wake up in the morning and will is desperate for the toilet. He leaves the room and immediately comes back and locks the door. There’s a monkey guarding the moon gate to the main path to the toilet. It’s baring its teeth and snarling at us. I pick up my bamboo walking stick and we go out together and investigate. Don’t worry will I’ve got this as I start banging my stick on the floor. This really riles the monkey and it starts approaching us. We both run back and I’ve made matters worse. We repeat this several times before the monkey finds something more interesting. Will legs it to the toilet and I go down to the dining room for breakfast. Tofu skins, a potato curry dish and some pickled greens. 

We spend the rest of the day hiking down to the bottom taking the gorge route down and it is beautiful. The water gleams glacial blue as butterflies dance around. Will finds a couple of 100 plants we have seen before. We walk through an avenue of hankerchief trees and will is just blown away. He must have said “I must come back in spring” at least 1000 times on the mountain. It was incredible beautiful in its pre autumnal state but the mind does wonder what the mountain looks like in full bloom! 

The story continues, down down down we go. Finally as we are arriving at the bus station I finally sea a green snake! Hallelujah!

Approximately 10 pence later we are back in emeishan town bus station and the great pilgrimage is complete. 1 Buddhist mountain down, 3 to go.
