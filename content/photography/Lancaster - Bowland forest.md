This photo was taken on a walk around Bowland forest whilst I was studying at the University of Lancaster. It must be dated around 2016 and was shot on a Rolleiflex camera with Rollei IR400 Film.

Ribblehead viaduct! This was taken on a separate trip. My friend Cristina convinced me and my friend Zane that this was infact the viaduct from Harry Potter that the Hogwarts Express crossed! It is not. We are idiots.
