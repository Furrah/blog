## Introduction 

The 
<a href=https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD5627R_5647R_5667R_5627_5667.pdf target="_blank">AD5627RBRMZ (Datasheet)</a> is part of a series of 12/14/16 bit nano DACs with an I2C interface.
The DAC we are interested in is the 12 bit AD5627RBRMZ which has a 5ppm/ËšC internal reference and can operate upto 5V.

## Design 

The DAC requires a high I2C level to be 0.8 * Vcc, which is 4V if we are interested in using the full capability of the DAC. In this design the I2C is operating on a 3.3 Volt bus, therefore, a bidirectional I2C level shiter is required. 

For this I am using the

## Operation

#### Addressing

The 7 bit address is set by the fist 5 MSBs 00011 and the state of the ADDR pin. 


<center>

| ADDR Pin Connection 	| A1 	| A0 	|
|---------------------	|:--:	|:--:	|
| VDD                 	|  0 	|  0 	|
| No Connection       	|  1 	|  0 	|
| GND                 	|  1 	|  1 	|

</center>

I have tied the pin to GND  so the address is 0011 11 - 0xF

#### Set Internal Reference
On start up the internal reference is set to off. To turn it on send the command 0x38,0x00,0x01

Command - Internal reference setup (on/off) - 111 <br>
Address - Both DACS <br>
Data - nothing <br>
LDAC control - The DAC registers are updated after new data is read in. <br>

Byte 1 - 0x3F - 00111111 <br>
Byte 2 - 0x00 - no data to send<br>
Byte 3 - 0x01 - 0000001 <br>

#### Setting Output Voltage
The voltage is set with a 16 bit data string but as the DAC is 12 bits the last 4 LSBs are not used. 

The voltage is set with a command followed by an address. 
command - Write to and update DAC channel n - 011
address - both DACs - 111

Bit 1 is reserved 
Bit 2 should be set to zero for 3 byte operation of chip

00011111 - 1F 

Data - 12 bits to make full scale value FFF so 50% voltage would be 7FF.

last 4 bits should be set to 1 for operation - F 

3 bytes = 0x1F,0x7F,0xFF
