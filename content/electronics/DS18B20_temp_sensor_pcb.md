## Introduction 

In 2013 I discovered the DS18B20 digital thermometer IC made by Maxim Integrated. It's a great little IC that has provides a 12 bit temperature measurement and interfaces over the 1-Wire bus allowing multiple sensors to be daisy chained! Back then I used veraboard and some terrible soldering to create the strings of sensors used in my greenhouse. Well its now 2022 and I'm back to thinking about greenhouses. 

## PCB Design

The design is about as simple as it comes. I've used 3x1 terminal blocks for the cable interface which could have been connectorised but I don't really ever plan on unplugging them.
Each board has a space for the pullup resistor which is required when using external power. The mounting hole size is 3mm.

## Raspberry Pi
**Enable 1-Wire interface**
1. ``` sudo rasbpi-config```
2. select interface options 
3. select I7 1-Wire and enable

pi pins 01 and 02 are closest to SD card.

**Testing**

 
navigate to ```cd /sys/bus/w1/devices```

I have 5 board daisy chained listed below 
```
28-301fbe0164ff  28-84ccbd0164ff  28-dfd5bd0164ff
28-4779be0164ff  28-c671b90164ff  w1_bus_master1
```

navigate to a sensors directory e.g. "28-301fbe0164ff"

``` cat w1_slave ```

returns 

```
56 01 55 00 7f ff 0c 10 46 : crc=46 YES
56 01 55 00 7f ff 0c 10 46 t=21375
```

where ```t=21375``` is the temperature in Celsius multiplied by 1000 so the temperature is 21.375 Â± 0.5 degrees C.
