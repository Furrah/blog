## Let The Build Begin

The date is the 5th of February 2022. It's cold. Really cold. My friend Will offered to help with the build. We had 48 hours to do so before getting back to work in Oxford on the Monday! So please excuse the messy wiring, we really didn't have much time or daylight!


Here are the panels and batteries

2x4 wooden frame to keep the panels off the ground as my dads one and only rule for having the panels was that he could mow the grass with ease.

Here we have the 6mm cable from the solar panels coming in on the top left into the breaker and then into the charge controller. A Raspberry pi is the brains of the operation with an arduino for analog sensors. In the bottom right is a custom relay board for controller 24V/16A loads

A heated seed tray that operates off mains which means.. An inverter is needed.
