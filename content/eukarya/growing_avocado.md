## Introduction 

I've just got back from the Isle of Skye in Scotland and have bought back 20 Avocado seeds left over from a weeks worth of communal meals. I've just moved to Oxford, although I am currently staying with my friend Adam in Abingdon and have decided to propagate the seeds in his apartment. Thanks Adam.

      Tooth pick up the seeds and suspend in water. There is a better method for this which is suspending the seed from the top and not tripoding like I have done. Next time....

		It has come to my attention that the method of growing of avocados in water is not optimum. The seeds grow mould on them and require their water to be changed frequently. 
    In an attempt to mitigate this I have removed all of the outer shell from the seeds apart from those that are showing signs of rooting which seems to have helped. I have also learnt that growing in water and transferring to soil can cause root shock, further stunting their growth.
