Just before I left Lincolnshire for another new chapter of life I took a few photos of the butternut squash plants my dad and I had planted out earlier in the season. Lesson number one would be to grow these plants up trellis' as they spread out everywhere and climb up anything they can. Whilst we have 3 or 4 very developed fruits on the plant I was drawn to the little baby growing up towards the fence. You can see the runners the plant puts out to grapple onto anything it can as it climbs. Pretty groovy if you ask me!
