## Film Development 

A little tutorial for sam :p 

For developing Ilford HP5 with D-76 developer the
<a href=https://www.digitaltruth.com/ target="_blank">Massive dev chart</a> must be consulted! 

select the film and developer from the drop down menus.

I like to use 1:1 dilution ratio so for one roll of 35mm HP5 film at ISO 400 the development time is 13 minutes. 

mix 150ml of water with 150ml of D76 solution and ensure the temperature is 20 degrees Â± 0.5 degrees should be fine! 

## Method 

1. Fill the light box up with the 300ml of solution and agitate every minute. I like to rotate the box for 10 seconds ish and then an invert. 
2. After the development process is complete empty the container and rinse with water for 4 minutes. Try to do this at the same temperature as the developer. 
3. Fill the container up with diluted fix and leave for 10 minutes. Again agitating every minute. 
4. Rinse with water for 4 more minutes and your done!
