Recipe taken from 
<a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipe/halloumi-broccoli-tabbouleh-honey-harissa-dressing" target="_blank">BBC Good Food - Tabbouleh with Halloumi and Broccoli.</a> 


## Ingredients 

* 140g couscous
* 300g broccoli florets
* 6 spring onions , finely sliced
* 150g cherry tomato, quartered
* large bunch parsley, finely chopped
* small bunch mint, finely chopped
* juice 2 lemons, zest of ½ lemon
* 2½ tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1½ tbsp harissa or sriracha 
* 1 tbsp clear honey
* 2 x 250g packs halloumi cheese, cut into 1cm-thick slices
* 25g fresh almonds.

## Method 

* Put the couscous into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Cover with cling film and set aside for 5 mins.
* Blanch the broccoli for 2 mins, then drain well. Cut it into small pieces or blitz it in a food processor.
* Fork the broccoli, spring onions, tomatoes, herbs, lemon zest, the juice of 1½ lemons and 2 tbsp oil through the couscous. Season and mix well.
* To make the dressing, combine the harissa, honey, remaining lemon juice and oil, and some seasoning.
* Heat a non-stick frying pan and cook the halloumi for 1-2 mins on each side until golden. Divide the couscous between the plates, top with the halloumi slices and dressing, then scatter over the almonds (sometimes i like to toast the almonds for a couple of minutes in pan). 


## Comments 

I always make this racipe with srirasha sauce. For the sauce I use a ratio of 2:2:1 of lemon,sriracha,honey. Taste and change for desired flavour. I also find fresh almonds are better than toasted.
