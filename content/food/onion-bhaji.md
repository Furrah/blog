## Ingredients 

* 6 level tbsp plain flour
* 1 level tsp turmeric
* 1 level tsp ground cumin
* 1 level tsp garam masala
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 med onions, peeled and sliced
* Raita (minty yogurt), to serve, optional
* Deep-frying pan, with oil



## Method

* Heat the oil in the deep-frying pan to 190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5.

* Mix the flour, spices and salt together in a bowl and add 3-4 tbsp water, to make a stiff batter. Stir the onions into the batter, to coat.

* Add a spoonful of the onion mixture to the pan. When it rises to the surface, add the next spoonful. Continue doing this until the pan is full. Cook for 3-4 mins until the bhajis are cooked, turning them over halfway through. Remove from the pan and drain them on absorbent kitchen paper.

* Cook the remainder of the onion mixture. The onion bhaji may be served immediately or reheated on a baking sheet in a hot oven for a few mins. Serve with raita, if you like.
