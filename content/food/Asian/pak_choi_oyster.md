# A Lil Story 

Sam had just started her job at CERN in Switzerland and I had just finished building the Bluehouse. 
I desperately wanted to be able to grow something before living between Oxford, Wales, and Geneva. 
pak choi takes around 40 days to grow from seed to full maturity and it was still early spring time (late march) 
so hopefully the pak choi wouldn't bolt (It did). Still, I managed to grow some! I had left it growing for too long 
and had been very busy all weekend getting my wedding suit and hanging out with as many of my friends in Oxford as possible. 
It got to 9pm on the Sunday and It was really now or never that I cooked the pak choi up. I desperately wanted to grow and eat something from the Bluehouse 
so I made this. Now, it did not go to plan, it came out very watery but it tasted great and only took about 10 mins to make.
