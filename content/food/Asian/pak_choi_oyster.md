# A Lil Story 

Sam had just started her job at CERN in Switzerland and I had just finished building the Bluehouse. 
I desperately wanted to grow something before living between Oxford, Wales, and Geneva as it would become impossible to do so after (It did). 

Pak choi takes around 40 days to grow from seed to full maturity and it was still early spring time (late march) 
so hopefully the pak choi wouldn't bolt (It did). In that time I did manage to grow some with the occasional help of friends dropping in to water them whilst I was away, though I had left it growing for too long and it had bolted.


In early May I came back to Oxford for the weekend but had been very busy getting my wedding suit and hanging out with as many of my friends as possible. 
It got to 9pm on the Sunday and It was really now or never that I cooked the pak choi up. Now, it did not go to plan, it came out very watery but it tasted great and only took about 10 mins to make. I will make this again and pay more attention to what im doing.
