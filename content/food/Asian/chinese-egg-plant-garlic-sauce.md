## Ingredients

Serves: 6 

* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 4 Chinese eggplants, halved lengthways, then cut into 2cm slices
* 1 cup (250ml) water
* 1 tablespoon crushed dried red chilli flakes
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 tablespoon white sugar
* 1 teaspoon cornflour
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce (or vegetarian alternative!)

* Heat the oil in a wok or frypan over high heat. Add the eggplant and stir the eggplant until soft, about 4 minutes.
* Stir in the water, dried chilli flakes and garlic. Cover and simmer until all the water is absorbed. Meanwhile, mix sugar, cornflour, soy sauce and oyster sauce together in a bowl until sugar and cornflour have dissolved. Stir sauce into the eggplant, making sure to evenly coat the eggplant. Cook until the sauce has thickened.
