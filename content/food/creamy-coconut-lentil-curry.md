Recipe taken from : https://www.theendlessmeal.com/creamy-coconut-lentil-curry/

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons coconut oil
* 1 tablespoon each: cumin seeds and coriander seeds
* 1 head of garlic, chopped (10–12 cloves)
* 1 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons ginger, chopped
* 1 tablespoon turmeric
* 2 teaspoons sea salt
* 1 cup dried brown lentils
* 1–2 teaspoons cayenne powder, optional
* 1 15-ounce can coconut milk
* A few handfuls of cherry tomatoes
* 1 cup chopped cilantro

## Method

* Heat the coconut oil in a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and toast until they start to brown, about 45 seconds. Add the garlic to the pot and let it brown, about 2 minutes.
<br><br>
* Add the can of crushed tomatoes, ginger, turmeric, and sea salt to the pot and cook, stirring the pot a few times, for 5 minutes. Add the lentils and, if using, the cayenne powder, and 3 cups of water to the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until the lentils are soft. Stir the pot a few times to prevent the lentils from sticking to the bottom. If the curry starts to look dry, add an extra 1/2 – 1 cup of water.
<br><br>
* Once the lentils are soft, add the coconut milk and cherry tomatoes and bring the pot back to a simmer. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cilantro.
