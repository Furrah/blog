One of my Grandmas recipes for red onion soup I found whilst rummaging around her stack of recipes she has in her kitchen. This is one of the few that didn't involve copious amounts of meat! I found this particular recipe quite the riddle.


## Ingredients

* 2 oz butter
* 2lb red onion thinly sliced
* 1 tbsp veg oil
* 1 tsp salt
* ½ tsp brown sugar  
* 1½ oz plain flour
* 3 pints brown stock
* ½ pint stout or brown ale

## Method

1. Gently cook onions in butter and oil in a large pan for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally.
2. Remove lid, add salt, sugar, and cook further for 30-40 minutes until golden brown.
3. Remove from heat and stir in flour, stock, and beer.
