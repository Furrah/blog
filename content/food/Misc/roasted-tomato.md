A quick recipe from my house mate Lou. A great afternoon snack!

## Ingredients

* 1 Beef tomato or tomato of your choice cut into 2-3cm chunks 
* A few sprigs of thyme 
* 3 Cloves of garlic - whole 
* Olive oil 
* Balsamic vinegar 


## Method 
1. Preheat oven to 180 C
2. Add tomato, thyme and garlic into oven tray and cover in oil 
3. Season with salt and pepper 
4. Roast for 20- 30 minutes 
5. Drizzle balsamic vinegar and remove thyme. 

I like to eat this on toast, spreading the garlic as a base :)
