I don't know if these beans are American but this recipe comes from an American man who may or may not have been a cowboy. He called this recipe his cowboy breakfast! Sam and I met him in Pembrokeshire  on our minimoon after getting married! 

This is a super quick meal that goes great on toast with a lil bit of hot sauce. Also goes great with scrambled egg. 

## Ingredients 

* 1 medium onion finely chopped 
* 3-5 spring onions not as finely chopped... 
* 1 medium red onion finely chopped 
* 1 tbsp rapeseed oil 
* 4 garlic cloves 
* As much butter as you want
* 1 can white beans 
* 1 can other beans 
* 1-2 tsp smoked paprika

## Method 

1. Fry onions in oil 
2. Add garlic once onions are sweet and cooked 
2. Add beans, butter, and smoked paprika 
3. blend a third of the beany oniony goodness to make it creamy 
4. Add water if it has dried out a bit. You want it to be creamy. 
5. Serve on toast with some hot sauce.
