This recipe comes form my friend Tom who adapted the BBC goodfoods recipe. For my take I don't add chocolate to it because chocolate belongs in chocolate bars. <a href=https://tomdod.github.io/food/bananabread/ target="_blank">Link to Toms website Here!</a>

## Ingredients 

* 125g margarine (or butter)
* 125g sugar (half white, half brown)
* 2 small eggs, beaten
* 125g flour (farine bise)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 ripe bananas
* Handful walnuts
* Handful dark chocolate chunks

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 190C.
2. Line the loaf tin (25cm) with greaseproof paper and lightly butter it.
3. Melt butter/marg in a metal bowl over hot water.
4. Add the sugar, mixing well.
5. Slowly add 2 beaten eggs with half the flour.
6. Add the remaining flour, baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.
7. Cook until a test skewer comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
8. Leave to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
