## Ingredients 

* 3 long Chinese eggplants (about 600g) or small green type - I prefer the small green as they are crunchy! 
* Sea salt
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns, coarsely crushed - substitute with crushed coriander seeds, crushed pepper corns and a small amount of grated lemon
* 1 green chillis, thinly sliced
* 2 Tbsp doubanjiang
* 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 2.5cm knob of ginger, grated
* 1 spring onion, thinly sliced
* Handful of coriander leaves, roughly chopped (optional)
* Steamed jasmine rice, to serve

Yu xiang sauce
* 1 tsp light soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp Shaoxing rice wine
* 1 Tbsp Chinese black vinegar - rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar alternatives 
* 2 tsp cornflour
* 1 Tbsp sugar

## Method 

1. Cut aubergine in half or quarters if using small green type. 
2. Soak in salted water (use plenty) for 20 minutes and then dry.
3. Whilst Soaking make the Yu Xiang Sauce and set to one side.  
4. Heat oil on a high heat in a large pan and fry the aubergine for 2-5 minutes - until nicely browned.
5. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli,  doubanjiang, and pepper corns and fry for a minute.
6. Add the sauce and stir in. Add more water if required for a thinner sauce. 
7. Garnish with Spring onion and serve with rice.
