## Ingredients 

* 25 g butter
* 2 small leeks sliced
* 150 g chestnut mushrooms thinly sliced
* 200 g Quorn chicken pieces (or 400g leftover roast chicken or 2 small chicken breasts)
* 1 tablespoon plain flour
* 1 vegetable stock cube (or 1 chicken stock cube)
* 300 ml boiling water
* 300 ml crème fraîche
* 1 tablespoon thyme leaves
* Salt and pepper
* 500 g block puff pastry
* A small amount of milk
* 4 large Potato's 


## Method 

1. Pre-heat the oven to 220C / 200C fan / gas mark 7 / 425F.
2. Melt the butter in a deep, wide pan over a low heat. Add the leeks, stir and put the lid on. Cook for about 5 minutes until soft. Stir occasionally.
3. Take the lid off, add the mushrooms and turn the heat up. Cook for 2 minutes and then add the Quorn chicken pieces. Cook for 2 more minutes.
4. Meanwhile make a simple gravy: put the plain flour in a jug. Crumble in the stock cube and mix together with a small amount of cold water. Add the boiling water and stir.
5. When the Quorn chicken pieces have cooked for 2 minutes, add the gravy and the crème fraîche and stir. Add the salt, pepper and thyme and bring to the boil. Bubble for 2 minutes and then pour into a large oven dish.
6. Roll out 1 pack of puff pastry to about 5cm bigger (in each direction) than your oven dish. Score the pastry gently in a crisscross design.
7. Brush the pastry with a little milk and then place the pastry over the filling, tucking in the excess.
8. Cook the pie in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until the top is puffy and brown and the filling is bubbling.
9. Serve with mash.
