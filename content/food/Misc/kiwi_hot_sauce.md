This is a lacto fermented hot sauce! I used Gochugaru chilli peppers for this ferment which give a very mild hot sauce. A more common chilli for this type of ferment is the jalepeno 

# Ingredients

* 20-25 Green chillis heads removed and chopped lengthways
* 2 spring onions, chopped
* 70g fresh corriander
* 6 kiwis sliced thinly with skins
* Salt
* Water
* 500ml Apple cider vinegar


# Method

**Fermentation**
1. Sterilise Kilner jar in oven at 110C for 30 mins. 
2. Allow jar to cool and take note of the weight of the jar
3. Add all the vegetables to the jar and fill remaining space with water
4. Add 2.5% by weight of salt to the vegetables and water
5. Leave for 2-3 weeks and allow to ferment, remembering to burp once a day. 

**Bottle up**

1. Strain the ferment and keep the brine to one side 
2. Blend the solids and then add the apple cider vinegar.
3. Add 500ml of the brine back to the solids and taste.
4. Add more brine or vinegar to taste. 
5. Bottle up

# Notes

The ferment will go cloudy after a couple of days. This is a good thing. It is the Lacto bacteria growing and becoming the dominant bacteria present in the ferment. You can see the difference between the first (Day 1) and second picture (Day 7).
