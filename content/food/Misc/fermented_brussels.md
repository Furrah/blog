This was the first fermentation Sam and I tried. We made multiple batches at 2.2% and 3% salt concentrations. For this ferment, we used:

* 1 tbsp yellow mustard seeds
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 tbsp chili flakes
* Brussels sprouts


Since it was our first attempt, we didn’t really know what we were doing. We chopped up the Brussels sprouts, added them to a Kilner jar, and filled the jar to the brim with water. We took the total weight and added 2.2% salt by mass. Then we added the other ingredients.

It’s been in the fridge for 3 months now and still tastes great! The Brussels sprouts are still crunchy, BUT the mustard flavor is super overpowering. Note to self: next time, use way less mustard seeds!
