## Ingredients 

* 3 eggs boiled, peeled and halved
* 2 vegetable oil
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 1 medium onion finely chopped (or 5-7 small shallots thinly sliced)
* 1 small cinnamon stick halved
* 2 green chillies slit lengthwise
* 2 tomatoes roughly chopped
* 1” piece ginger thinly sliced
* ½ tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder (or mild chilli powder)
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp tamarind concentrate
* 100mls water
* 50mls coconut milk
* 8-10 curry leaves
* Salt to taste

## Method

* Heat the oil in a heavy bottom sauce pan. Add the mustard seeds letting them splutter for a few seconds. Add the onions and fry for 5-7 minutes on medium as they begin to turn light brown. Add the cinnamon stick and green chillies frying for a further minute. Tip in the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes stirring well ensuring it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. The tomatoes will soften and form a thick sauce.

* Add the sliced ginger and fry for a further minute. Now add the powdered spices and stir for a minute. At this point the oil will start to leave the sides of the pan. Add the tamarind concentrate along with the water. Bring to a boil and simmer. At this stage add the coconut milk. Simmer gently and tip in the halved boiled eggs along with the curry leaves.

* Let the eggs soak in the spices for 2-3 minutes. Stir gently making sure the eggs stay intact. Season to taste and garnish with coriander. Serve with soft dosas or plain rice.

## Comments

Be careful with the tamarind paste, it can be really sour! I think next I might add mushrooms to this. When making this I accidently used a tin of tomatoes instead of fresh... Also used 200ml of Coconut milk... I'd like to make it properly next time! Also mango chutney would go lovely with this one!
