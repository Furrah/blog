* 4 green cardamom
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 3 cloves

**Kadai Paneer**

* 1 tablespoon butter, unsalted
* 1 tablespoon oil, 15 ml, I used avocado oil
* 1 medium red onion, 150 grams, finely chopped
* 1 green chili, sliced
* 2 teaspoons ginger garlic paste
* 3-4 medium tomatoes, 450 grams, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste, optional
* 1/4 teaspoon garam masala
* 3/4 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder
* 1 inch ginger, julienned, divided
* 1/2 cup water, 4 oz/120 ml
* 2 tablespoons heavy cream, 30 ml
* 3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 large green bell pepper (capsicum), cut into 1-inch pieces

* 1 teaspoon kasuri methi, dried fenugreek leaves
* cilantro, to garnish

## Method 

**Make the Kadai Masala**

* To a small kadai or pan, dry roast the spices for kadai masala for 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat until fragrant.  Add more red chilies for a spicier masala.

* Remove kadai from heat and transfer the roasted spices to a spice grinder.

* Let it cool down a bit and then grind to a fine powder. Set aside. You can also make this kadai masala in advance and store it.

**Make the Kadai Paneer**

* In a large kadai or any other pan, now melt butter with oil on medium heat.

* Add the chopped onion and saute for 3 minutes until softened. Then add the sliced green chili and ginger garlic paste and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes.

* Then add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste. Mix and cook for around 6 minutes until tomatoes are really soft.

* Then add 3 to 4 teaspoons of the kadai masala that you prepared earlier (or add the whole thing if you like it spicy). Also add the garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder.

* Add half of the ginger julienne. Stir the spices and cook for 30 seconds.

* Then add 1/2 cup water and stir.

* Add cream, salt and sugar and mix. Cook for one minute.

* Add in the paneer and bell peppers (capsicum) and mix. Cover the pan or kadai with a lid and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on medium heat until bell peppers are slightly softened. You only want them half cooked here.

* Crush kasuri methi and add to the pan.

* Garnish with remaining ginger julienne and cilantro. Serve kadai paneer with naan or paratha.
