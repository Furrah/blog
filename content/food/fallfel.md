## Ingredients

* 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup fresh parsley leaves, tightly-packed
* 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, tightly-packed
* 1/2 cup diced red or yellow onion
* 1/3 cup flour (such as all-purpose, white whole wheat, chickpea, or a 1:1 gluten-free flour)
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 6 small garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
* 4–6 tablespoons high-heat oil (such as avocado oil, grapeseed oil or vegetable oil)
* for serving: pita bread, chopped lettuce, sliced red onions, sliced tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, tahini sauce and/or hummus

## Method

* Roughly purée your ingredients. You can either do this in a food processor (my recommendation), a stand mixer, or a blender.  Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine-grain texture (kind of like coarse sand, ideally not overly mushy).
* Chill. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for a few hours until chilled.  (Or you can speed this process up by spreading the mixture out in a shallow layer and popping it in the freezer for 30-45 minutes until chilled.)
* Form into patties.  Use a medium (2-tablespoon) cookie scoop or a spoon to scoop out 2 tablespoons of the mixture, and then use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Lay the ball on a parchment-covered sheet, then gently flatten it slightly with your hand so that it is about 1/2-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining dough mixture.
* Pan-fry the falafel.  Heat the oil over medium-heat.  Then carefully add about 4-5 falafel to the oil and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side until browned and crispy.  Transfer the falafels to a plate lined with paper-towels to soak up any extra oil.  Repeat with the remaining falafels.
* Serve! Then serve them up while they’re nice and warm and crispy, and enjoy!
