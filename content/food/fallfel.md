## Ingredients

* Chickpeas: I use canned chickpeas to save a step, rinsed and drained.
* Fresh herbs: I love brightening up my falafel with lots and lots of fresh cilantro and parsley!  The fresh taste is unbeatable, and all of those herbs also the falafel a lovely green hue.
* Garlic: Feel free to add a little extra garlic to the recipe below if you’re a mega garlic lover.
* Onion: White, red or yellow will work.
* Flour: I typically use white whole wheat flour, but feel free to use your preferred kind of flour.  (This gluten-free flour blend also works great.)
* Oil: Any mild high-heat oil will work here, such as avocado, grapeseed or vegetable oil.
* Baking powder: To make the falafel a bit more light and airy.
* Seasonings: Fine sea salt, black pepper and ground cumin.
* Lemon juice: The final ingredient to round out all of those yummy fresh flavors. 

## Method

* Roughly purée your ingredients. You can either do this in a food processor (my recommendation), a stand mixer, or a blender.  Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine-grain texture (kind of like coarse sand, ideally not overly mushy).
* Chill. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for a few hours until chilled.  (Or you can speed this process up by spreading the mixture out in a shallow layer and popping it in the freezer for 30-45 minutes until chilled.)
* Form into patties.  Use a medium (2-tablespoon) cookie scoop or a spoon to scoop out 2 tablespoons of the mixture, and then use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Lay the ball on a parchment-covered sheet, then gently flatten it slightly with your hand so that it is about 1/2-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining dough mixture.
* Pan-fry the falafel.  Heat the oil over medium-heat.  Then carefully add about 4-5 falafel to the oil and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side until browned and crispy.  Transfer the falafels to a plate lined with paper-towels to soak up any extra oil.  Repeat with the remaining falafels.
* Serve! Then serve them up while they’re nice and warm and crispy, and enjoy!
