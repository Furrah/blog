Recipe taken from: http://fatimacooks.net/recipe/anda-bhuna/

## Ingredients 

Serves 2

* 1 medium onion, sliced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* small piece ginger, minced
* 2 medium tomatoes, sliced
* 4 hard boiled eggs
* salt, to taste
* 0.75 tsp red chilli powder
* 0.75 tsp cumin powder
* 0.75 tsp coriander powder
* 0.5 tsp turmeric powder

## Method 

* In a pan, heat your oil and add the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute till golden, but ensure that the onions do not burn
* Add the tomatoes, all the spices and a splash of water. Cook on high
* Continue to cook on high, stirring continuously until the masala dries out and begins to gather in the centre
* At this point, add the hardboiled eggs and stir in. You can cut 4 shallow slits into the egg using a sharp knife to allow some of the flavour and masala to seep in
* Garnish with coriander and serve immediately.


## Comments

Added some mushrooms to this as I had them spare, they were great! Also added some tomato paste to give it a depper colour as the tomatoes I used had lost some of their water content. Be careful with the tumeric. Next time I think I will add more water, perhaps 1 mug full.
