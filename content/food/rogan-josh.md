## Ingredients

* 4 garlic cloves
* 4cm piece fresh ginger
* 3 fresh red chillies
* 1 tbsp tomato purée
* 60ml water
* 1 large aubergine
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 4 green cardamom pods
* 1 onion
* 6 black peppercorns
* 1 bay leaf
* 1½cm cinnamon stick
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* 100g coconut yoghurt
* large pinch of garam masala
* handful coriander, to serve
* handful desiccated coconut flakes, to serve
* salt

## Method

* Peel the garlic and ginger and put them into the liquidiser. Rip the stems from 2 of the chillies, removing the seeds if you prefer a milder sauce, and add them to the liquidiser. Add the tomato purée and 60ml water and blend to a smooth paste (add more water if needed).<br><br>
* Trim the aubergine and cut it into 1 x 3cm chunks. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to the large frying pan. Add the aubergine and cook for about10–15 minutes, turning regularly, until well browned on each side.<br><br>
* While the aubergine is cooking, put the cardamom pods in a mortar and pestle and bash them to release the seeds (or use the end of a rolling pin). Discard the shells. Peel and finely chop the onion.<br><br>
* When the aubergine is browned, tip it on to a plate and set aside. Add the remaining oil to the pan along with the cardamom, peppercorns, bay leaf and cinnamon and fry for 2 minutes. Add the chopped onion and sugar. Reduce the heat to medium and sauté for about 10–15 minutes, stirring the onions until they’ve softened (add a splash more oil to the pan if the onions begin to stick).<br><br>
* Add the ginger paste from the liquidiser to the saucepan. Add the ground cumin and coriander and mix everything together well. Put the pan on a medium-high heat and fry for 5 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the aubergine cubes and stir well. Add the coconut yoghurt and stir it in (if it’s too thick, add a little water to loosen – you want a thick, gravy-like consistency). Cover with the lid and cook for 5 minutes.<br><br>
* Rip the stem from the remaining chilli, cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds if you prefer a milder flavour, then slice finely. Taste the curry and season with salt or garam masala as necessary. Serve up on to bowls or plates, sprinkled with a little fresh coriander, desiccated coconut flakes and the finely sliced chilli.
